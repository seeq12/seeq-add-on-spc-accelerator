# Introduction

The SPC Accelerator Add-on enables users to quickly and easily build SPC charts with Western Electric or Nelson Run Rule Conditions. 

The SPC Chart created with the Add-on is a simple implementation of an Individuals Chart, or I-Chart in Seeq, using the standard deviation (not the average of moving range) to construct the +/- sigma limits.
